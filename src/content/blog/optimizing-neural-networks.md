# Optimizing Neural Networks for Production

Based on my work with VodafoneZiggo's AI agents and LVNL's traffic prediction models, I've gathered practical insights into deploying ML models in production environments.

## Key Considerations

1. Model compression techniques
2. Inference optimization
3. Monitoring and maintenance
4. Hardware acceleration

## Implementation Strategy

The key to successful ML deployment is finding the right balance between model performance and operational efficiency.
