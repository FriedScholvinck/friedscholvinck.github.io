# Fried Scholvinck Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Development

To run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

This site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

When changes are pushed to the `main` branch, the GitHub Actions workflow will:

1. Build the Vite application
2. Deploy the built files to GitHub Pages

The live site is available at: https://friedscholvinck.github.io/
